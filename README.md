# Rodrigo Bonatti - About

My name is Rodrigo Bonatti and I have 20 years old. I’ve born in Brazil and since I was a child I have been fascinated about technologies and games. So my dream was always to have the best technology and with the years goes by I started to become passionated about automation.

So when I finished High School I’ve began to study Control and Automation Engineering because my dream at that time was to automate houses and make the people’s life easier.

At the same time that I was studying my Bachelor’s Degree I studied to get a Insurance Broker Certificate because my father is a Insurance Broker and he have a company. So when I got the certificate in 2021 I worked for 1 year with him in his company.

In 2021 I started to develop a passion for programming and the world of programming. So more precisely in the end of the year I’ve started to do a course of fullstack developer. But I didn’t learned a lot because I wasn’t prepared to learn this new world yet.

In the end of 2021 my friend invited me to went to Canada and without thinking twice I accepted. My first tough was about WMAD course but I was scared of been here for two years and the first idea was to came back to Brazil to continue my Bachelor’s Degree. So I just went to IBM course with him.

But in my first arrival here in Canada I meet some people of the programming world and realized that 1 year was to less time to spend here so I started to planning change the course to WMAD.

I changed the course and now I’m studying WMAD here at CICCC and I’ve started to do CS50x course too and I felt in love for programming. And now more than ever I’m completely sure that I want to be a programmer, not sure yet if FrontEnd or Fullstack but I’m starting to enjoy the path. And my dream goal is to work at Apple, the company that I’ve been a fan since than ever.
